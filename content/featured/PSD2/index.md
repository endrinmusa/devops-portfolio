PSD2 (Payment Service Directive 2) is a European regulation for electronic payment services. It seeks to make payments more secure in Europe, boost innovation and help banking services adapt to new technologies. I worked on this project as a DevOps Engineer with a team located in multiple locations in Europe including Austria, Romania, Croatia, Albania and Kosovo.
